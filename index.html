        <p class="card-text"> If a Waretag is separated from the user, the Waretag will send anonymous
  signals to other Android Phones around it. It will then relay its own
  location, through the nearest Android device, to its owner in the
  background, privately

        <p class="card-text">
        Waretags come with a user-replaceable battery. It  works fine for ‘over a year,’ after
     which the user will have to replace its battery. Waretags use the standard CR2032
     coin cell battery, which can be easily replaced by taking off its back cover.

        <h4 class="card-title">Privacy and Security</h4>
        <p class="card-text">  Waretag is designed from the ground up to keep location data private and secure.
     No location data or location history is physically stored inside Waretag.
     Communication with the Find My network is end-to-end encrypted so that only the
     owner of a device has access to its location data, and no one.

        <p class="card-text"> If you lose a Waretag, and cannot find its location, you can put the Waretag in the   ‘Lost Mode.’ This will create a trigger in  Find My network, and in case an Android device comes near to your Waretag, it will relay its location (privately) to your Phone</p>
